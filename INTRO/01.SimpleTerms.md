## SCALABILITY:
Scalability means the ability to grow your system's resources when your application or website gets more traffic or more users.

## TYPES:
1. VERTICAL SCALABILITY (SCALING UP):
  -Adding more power (CPU,RAM) to your existing server.
  - Eg: T2.micro, m5.large
    
2. HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY(SCALING OUT):
  -Adding more instances (servers) to distribute the load.
  - We can add more EC2 instances behind a load balancer.


## High Availability(HA):
High Availability means keeping your service up and running with minimal downtime, so its aalways accessible to users.
Eg; running resources in multiple AZs.

## Elasticity:
Ability to automatically adjust resources as the demand changes-more when needed and removing when no longer necessary.
Eg: ASG(Auto Scaling Group)

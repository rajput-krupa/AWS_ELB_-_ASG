For a Practical on Load Balancing.
We will first create 2 Instances(servers) to use the load balance.
I named it "webserver-1, webserver-2"

Here my instances are up and running.


Now we will create a load balancer:

## STEPS TO CREATE A LOAD BALANCER
As we have a application load balancer, 
We will select a application load balancer.

In security group create a new security group with HTTP enabled.

Now In Listeners and Routing,
Listener is Port 80,
now create a target group:

Select the web server to target:
Now again selet the target group made:

Now again if it is showing any probelm
Troubleshooting tip: 
Check whether the instance are actually registered to target??
Go to target group--> register a target--> select the target instances--> click "include as pending below" -->register pending targets

Here you see our load balancer is completely active and going to target.
